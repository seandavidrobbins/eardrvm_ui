## Daily Progress

#### Day 1
Spent the first night after class shooting around ideas of what project we wanted to create. First we were thinking about a sound share app, but in our limited time learning AWS and a media player functionality would be too much. So we decided on a picture sharing app, sort of like an imagur or instagram. Took some time to think of a name and set up the GitHub and Trello Team to collaborate. It was a very short night.

#### Day 2
Took most of the morning and afternoon to really nail down the Data modeling for our app, considering our MVP and our potential reach goals. After taking an afternoon of going over technical interviews with a guest speaker, Aaron and Eric did some pair programming to knock out the initial rails api up to the controllers and routes. Arron also set up a skeleton for the angular ui. 

#### Day 3
Aaron worked on finishing up the controllers, Sean worked on the angular partials for the layout and som initial views, and Eric worked on getting the AWS S3 and paperclip working to enable photo upload. Today was a long day for all three of us. Aaron expreience problems with getting user authentication to work, sean had merge conflict errors that was duplicating his html and css code. And Eric with getting through uploading a file through first angular to send to the backend and then validate it to upload it to AWS S3. Both Aaron and Eric got over their hump before they called it a day, Sean had made some decent progress fixing his styles. If user auth is done then the rails API is completed.
